# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Print the value and type of the variable

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to print the value and type of the variable.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Read input a from the user as a string.
2. Use eval() to convert a to its actual data type.
3. Store the result in evaluated_value.
4. Print the value and its data type.

## PROGRAM
```python
a = input()

# Use eval() to evaluate the input and determine its actual type
evaluated_value = eval(a)

# Print the value and its type
print(f"Value = {evaluated_value}")
print(f"type = {type(evaluated_value)}")

```
