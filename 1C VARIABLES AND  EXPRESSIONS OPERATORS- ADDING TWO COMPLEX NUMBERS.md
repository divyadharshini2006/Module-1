# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Subtracting Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To write a Python program for subtract two complex numbers, and get the user input.

## ALGORITHM
1. Initialize c1 as a complex number 8 + 4j.
2. Initialize c2 as a complex number 5 + 2j.
3. Add c1 and c2 to get c3.
4. Print the value of c3.

## PROGRAM
```python
c1=8+4j

c2=5+2j
c3=c1-c2
print(c3)
```
