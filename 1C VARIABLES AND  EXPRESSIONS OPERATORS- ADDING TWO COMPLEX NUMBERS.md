# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Comparing Ages of Two Persons

## AIM
To Write a python program to read the age of two persons and find who is elder and younger

## ALGORITHM
1. Read age1 and age2 as integers from the user.
2. Compare age1 and age2.
3. If age1 is greater, print that person 1 is elder and person 2 is younger.
4. Otherwise, print that person 2 is elder and person 1 is younger.
## PROGRAM
```python
age1=int(input())
age2=int(input())
if age1>age2:
    print("person 1 elder ")
    print("person 2 is younger")
